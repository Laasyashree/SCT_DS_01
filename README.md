# 🌍 SCT_DS_01 - World Population Visualization Project

Welcome to **SCT_DS_01**, a data visualization project built as part of my internship at **Prodigy InfoTech (Data Science Domain)**.

This task focuses on using Python to visualize a real-world dataset: **World Population** by country. It involves plotting **bar charts** and **histograms** to extract and communicate insightful patterns.

## 📊 Visualizations Performed

### 1. 📌 Bar Chart
- **X-axis:** Continents  
- **Y-axis:** Number of countries  
- **Insight:** Highlights how countries are distributed across continents

### 2. 📈 Histogram: 2022 Population
- Shows distribution of country populations
- Reveals population skewness and outliers

### 3. 📉 Histogram: Growth Rate
- Analyzes annual population growth rates
- Most countries hover near 1%

### 4. 📏 Histogram: Area (km²)
- Highlights variation in land sizes
- Shows how few countries have very large land areas

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- `Python`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `Jupyter Notebook`
